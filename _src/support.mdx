# Project Aria Support

## Overview

This page provides links to various troubleshooting pages, as well as how to request support or report an issue.


## Troubleshooting pages

* [Data Utilities Troubleshooting](/data_utilities/installation/troubleshooting.mdx)
* [Aria Glasses Quickstart Guide](/ARK/ARK_quickstart.mdx)
* [Aria Research Kit Troubleshooting ](/ARK/troubleshooting/troubleshooting_issues.mdx)
* [Client SDK and CLI Troubleshooting](/ARK/sdk/sdk_troubleshooting.mdx)


## How do I get support/report issues?

We encourage you to [post issues to GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/issues), so that they can be tracked.

If you are a Research Partner with access to the Aria Research Kit there are several other support options available, although GitHub is ideal for bug reports and feature requests.

* Post to Project Aria Discord - best for discussion, feedback or user support
* Post to [Academic Partners Feedback and Support workplace group](/ARK/workplacegroup.mdx) - discussion, feedback or user support
* Email AriaOps@meta.com - for feedback or user support
