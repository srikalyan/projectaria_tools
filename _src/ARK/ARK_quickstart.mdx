# Project Aria Glasses Quickstart

# Overview

This page provides a quick overview of what to do once you have received your Project Aria glasses. To find out how to get Aria Glasses, go to [projectaria.com](https://www.projectaria.com/research-kit/).


## Get set up

Once you've been approved and can receive your Aria glasses you will get two emails:

* Welcome to Aria
    * Contains your account details, use these for signing into the Mobile and Desktop Companion apps

    * Follow the prompts to join Aria's research community space where researchers and engineers at Meta and all our Academic partners can connect, ask questions, share ideas and provide support.
    * See [How to join the Academic Partner Workplace group](workplacegroup.mdx) for further instructions.

## Get connected

Before your glasses arrive we encourage you to join the [Academic Partners Workplace group](workplacegroup.mdx). It's a great place to get the latest announcements, provide feedback, ask questions. Unboxing videos are very welcome!

## Get to know your glasses

* [About the Aria Research Kit](/docs/ARK/about_ARK.mdx)
   * Includes hardware requirements for using ARK apps
* [Technical Specifications](/docs/tech_spec/tech_spec.mdx)
    * Go to the Tech Spec part of the wiki to find out about Aria capabilities, recording profiles etc
* [Glasses Manual](/docs/ARK/glasses_manual/glasses_user_manual.mdx)
    * Provides information about Project Aria glasses buttons, powering on and off, the privacy switch, how to do a factory reset, LED states, etc

## Update your glasses

You'll need to update your Aria glasses using the Mobile companion app before you can use them.

### Install the Mobile companion app

Follow the instructions in the [ARK SW Downloads and Updates page](/docs/ARK/ark_downloads) to download and install the app (this is where you'll download updates as well).

### Pair your glasses

1. Plug your glasses into power using the provided cable
2. Sign into the app using your provided user name and password
3. Follow the prompts to pair your glasses
    * Your glasses are automatically updated when you first pair them
    * Go to the [Mobile app page](/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app.mdx) for further information

Further updates will be queued automatically when you use your glasses via the Mobile Companion App. If you need to manually check for updates, select the gear icon (settings) next to your glasses and then select Check for OS Updates.

## Set your Default Recording Profile

You can set the default recording profile via Mobile or Desktop Companion App. Once set, this is the default profile used when recording or streaming data by any means.

When you select New Recording in the Mobile Companion app, you'll initially see the default recording profile. Select the recording profile to view sensor settings or to select a different recording profile.

In the Mobile Companion App, you can change the Default Recording Profile at any time via Device Settings (select the settings/gear icon next to your glasses on the dashboard).

## Install the Desktop app (Optional)

You need the Desktop app to request Machine Perception Services, but you don't need the  app to make recordings or download data. The app provides a visualization of streaming data over Wi-Fi, but it doesn't have the capabilities of the Client SDK and you can't subscribe to the data. Go to the [Desktop app page](desktop_companion_app.mdx) for more information.

Follow the instructions in the [ARK SW Downloads and Updates page](/docs/ARK/ark_downloads) to download and install the app (this is where you'll download updates as well).

## Install Client SDK and CLI (optional)

Once you've set up your glasses with the Mobile Companion app, researchers can use the Client SDK or CLI to directly interact with Aria glasses. This is particularly helpful for streaming and subscribing to sensor data.

Go to the [Client SDK and CLI section](/docs/ARK/sdk) for how to install the SDK and explore code samples.

## Record Data

It's best to start and stop recording using the Capture button, Mobile Companion app, the [CLI or SDK](/docs/ARK/sdk).

While you can start and stop recording using the Desktop app, one of the other methods will provide a smoother experience.

### General recording principles
* If you start recording with one method, you can stop recording using a different method
* Please allow a few seconds before the recording starts. You'll know recording has started when the Recording LEDs turn on
* The recording does not stop until the Recoding LED turns off
   * Because the Aria glasses need to finish indexing before the recording stops, may be a small delay between initiating the stop and the recording stopping
* The longer your glasses record for, the longer it takes a recording to stop
   * This is because the larger the VRS file, the more time it takes for a recording to finish indexing.
* Go to the [Aria Glasses User Manual](/docs/ARK/glasses_manual/glasses_user_manual) to see images of all the buttons as well as LED placement


### Press the Capture button

The capture button is located on the top right of your glasses. The capture button will use the default recording profile.

1. Press the capture button to start recording
2. Press the capture button to stop and save the recording

:::tip
Engaging the privacy switch instead of the Capture button will stop the recording and discard your recording. Discarded recordings cannot be retrieved.
:::

### Mobile Companion app

* Select New Recording Session in the Aria Dashboard to start recording
* Select Stop Recording in the app
    * Go to the [Mobile Companion App page](/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app.mdx) for more information

You can alter the Name and Notes of a recording by going to the Recordings menu, selecting a recording and then selecting **Edit**.


## Download data

Aria recordings are stored as a VRS file and an accompanying JSON file that includes the recording's metadata. Metadata includes:

* The name and description of the recording as shown in the Mobile Companion App
* The recording profile used
* What version of the Mobile Companion App was used to create the recording

Aria recordings are directly accessible from the glasses' storage. There are three ways you can download data to your local machine using:

* MTP
* Aria Desktop Companion App
* ADB commands

We recommend using MTP for a faster download experience.

### Use MTP via File Explorer

#### Windows & Linux

When you plug in your Aria glasses to your computer, you can navigate to it as if it were any other USB external storage device.

1. Plug your Aria glasses into your computer, using the supplied cable
    * Please allow a few minutes for your glasses to be detected
2. Your glasses will appear in your directory as an external drive called “Aria”
3. Select Aria and then go to Internal Storage > recording
4. In this folder you will see the .vrs file and .json file that stores the .vrs files' metadata
    * You'll also see a thumbnails folder, which contains the thumbnails that are used to provide previews of your content in the Mobile app
5. Copy the data to local storage

#### MacOS

MTP is not provided natively on MacOS, but there are lightweight tools that you can use, such as OpenMTP.

1. Download and install [OpenMTP](https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/)
2. Connect your Aria glasses to your computer
3. Open OpenMTP
4. Drag & drop Aria recordings from Aria's internal storage

### Use the Desktop App

Go to the Recordings section in the Desktop app to download your data. See the [Desktop App page](/docs/ARK/desktop_companion_app.mdx) for further information.

### Use ADB

[Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) (adb) is a command line tool that can be used with Aria glasses.

To download all your data:
```bash
adb pull /sdcard/recording /home/unixname/MyVRSFolder
```

To download a single VRS file
```bash
adb pull /sdcard/recording/myVrsFile.vrs /home/unixname/MyVRSFolder/
```

To download a single metadata file
```bash
adb pull /sdcard/recording/myVrsFile.json /home/unixname/MyVRSFolder/
```

## Streaming

Install the [CLient SDK](/docs/ARK/sdk/sdk.mdx) to stream Aria data.

### Access basic visualization
Through the Desktop app, you can view streaming data, however it does not have the capabilities of the Client SDK and you can't subscribe to the data. When using the Desktop app, we recommend only using Profiles 12 and 18, which are optimized for streaming.

Go to the [Desktop app page](/docs/ARK/desktop_companion_app.mdx#streaming) for detailed instructions.
