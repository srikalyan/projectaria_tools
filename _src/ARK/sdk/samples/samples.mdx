# Project Aria Client SDK Code Samples


This section provides code samples and walkthroughs for using the Aria Client SDK to interact with the Project Aria glasses.

* [Connection](/docs/ARK/sdk/samples/device_connection)
    * Connect to the Aria glasses using USB and Wi-Fi
    * Fetch device information, such as the device serial number
    * Fetch device status, such as battery level or Wi-Fi SSID.
* [Recording](/docs/ARK/sdk/samples/device_recording)
    * Start and stop recording on an Aria device via USB and Wi-Fi
    * Set a [recording profile](/docs/tech_spec/recording_profiles) for a recording
* [Streaming Subscription](/docs/ARK/sdk/samples/streaming_subscribe)
    * Subscribe to and unsubscribe from a streaming session
    * Visualize the live stream
* [Streaming and Visualizing All Live Sensor Data](/docs/ARK/sdk/samples/device_stream)
    * Start and stop streaming from an Aria device to a computer via USB and Wi-Fi
    * Add callbacks to visualize and manipulate the streamed data
* [Streaming Undistorted RGB Image Using Calibration](/docs/ARK/sdk/samples/undistort_rgb_image)
    * Start and stop streaming from an Aria device to a computer via USB and Wi-Fi
    * Access sensor calibration and undistort an RGB live stream

Make sure you have finished the [Setup Guide](/docs/ARK/sdk/setup.mdx).

We recommend starting with [device_connect.py](/docs/ARK/sdk/samples/device_connection) to validate that your Aria glasses have connected successfully.
