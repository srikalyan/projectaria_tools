# Project Aria Client SDK

The Project Aria Client SDK provides versatile APIs to help you create your own machine perception Python applications with Project Aria glasses.

### Client SDK features

After connecting your Project Aria glasses and PC via USB or WiFi, you will be able to:
- Retrieve device information, status and sensor calibration data
- Start and stop recording
- Configure, start and stop streaming from the glasses
- Subscribe to streaming data from the glasses

### Project Aria CLI

In addition to APIs and code samples, the SDK also provides [Aria CLI](/docs/ARK/sdk/cli) which allows you to control an Project Aria glasses and to stream its data without touching any code.

:::info
The current SDK supports one pair of Aria glasses connected to one computer.
