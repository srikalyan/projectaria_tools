# MPS CLI

## Overview


The Project Aria MPS Command Line Interface (MPS CLI) is part of Project Aria Tools and it is the preferred way to request [Machine Perception Services (MPS)](/ARK/mps/mps.mdx). While research partners can use the Desktop Companion app to request MPS, the MPS CLI provides more features and uploads can resume if interrupted.

MPS CLI features:

* Request SLAM (trajectory, point cloud, online sensor calibration) and eye gaze data
* Request multi-sequence SLAM data
* Auto run health checks prior to upload
    * Recordings will not be uploaded if they are not valid for any of the MPS services requested
* Resumable uploads
    * Uploads, interrupted for any reason, can be resumed within 24 hrs
    * Particularly useful for large VRS files
* Concurrent processing
    * CLI takes a list of directories/files as input and recursively finds all .vrs files to process concurrently
    * The number of concurrent processes for each stage can be modified in [Settings](mps_cli_guide.mdx#settings)
* Automatically downloads outputs once processing is complete
* Recordings are processed once
    * If the output directory already exists and contains the MPS results, processing is skipped
    * If the recording was processed in the past, the results will be downloaded without submitting the recording for processing again (unless --force is passed as an input)
* Uploaded data is stored for 30 days
    * Additional MPS can be requested without needing to upload again
    * Data can be reprocessed without needing to upload again
* CLI can be integrated into your automated workflows
    * This includes ensuring that all commands and processes work without using the UI
    * See the [Command Line Reference](mps_cli_guide.mdx#command-line-reference) for more details
