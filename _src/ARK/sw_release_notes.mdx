Update Project Aria Tools:

* Python users: [Update projectaria_tools python package](/docs/data_utilities/installation/installation_python)
* C++ users: [Update projectaria_tools git repository](/docs/data_utilities/installation/download_codebase)

Open Science releases can be helpful for users with or without access to Aria glasses.

### Aria Research Kit Release Notes

#### Project Aria Client SDK with CLI

`projectaria_client_sdk` is a new Python package/client library that enables you to directly interact with your Project Aria glasses from a client machine. This enables you to stream Aria data and run MP algorithms on that data, in real-time.

The Client SDK currently offers the ability to:

* Connect and disconnect from the device via USB and WiFi
* Retrieve detailed device information and its current status
* Control Aria streaming and recording capabilities
* Access calibration data for the sensors you're recording with
* Subscribe and listen to Aria sensors data
* Visualize streaming data

A CLI, installed as part of the SDK, provides the ability to:

* Pair the glasses via USB or Wi-Fi
* Connect to the glasses via USB or Wi-Fi
* Retrieve the device status and information
* Control Aria recording and streaming capabilities


To support this new feature, we’ve added a Client SDK section to ARK Documentation in Project Aria Tools, including:

* [Project Aria Client SDK](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/sdk)
* [Setup Guide](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/sdk/setup)
* [Code Sample Examples and Walkthroughs](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/sdk/samples)

#### New & Improved Machine Perception Service: Calibrated Eye Gaze

You can now generate Calibrated Eye Gaze MPS for sequences captured on Project Aria glasses that have in-session Eye Gaze Calibration. This enables you to capture more data about how Aria wearers look at objects, and improve the eye gaze estimations for any given recording.

When you request Eye Gaze Machine Perception Services (MPS) and the file has an in-session Eye Gaze Calibration as part of the VRS file, you will receive two outputs:

* `generalized_eye_gaze.csv` - based on the standard eye gaze configuration
* `calibrated_eye_gaze.csv` - calibrated eye gaze data based on the calibration data collected in the recording.

Additional improvements to Eye Gaze MPS include:

* `Summary.json` files are also now available for Eye Gaze MPS output
* We’ve created a new visualization tool, [MPS Replay Viewer (C++)](/docs/data_utilities/visualization/visualization_cpp#mps-3d-replay-visualizer),  to render static scene and dynamic elements.

See below for more details:

* [How to collect in-session eye gaze calibration data](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/mps/eye_gaze_calibration)
* [Eye Gaze Data Format documentation](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_formats/mps/mps_eye_gaze) - updated to reflect new outputs

#### Mobile Companion App improvements (and now available on iOS)

The Aria Mobile Companion App allows users to interact with their Aria glasses via mobile device. With this release, users will now be able to download the app on iOS as beta testing software via Testflight.

Installing or updating the Mobile Companion app on Android just became easier. You no longer need to sign in to the partner portal to ARK specific software. You can download it as a direct link from the ARK SW Downloads and Updates page or from an update prompt in the app.

Additionally, you’ll now have the ability to change the default [Recording Profile](/docs/ARK/glasses_manual/profile_guide) when you make a recording using the Mobile Companion app.

See below for more details:

* [ARK SW Downloads and Updates](/docs/ARK/ark_downloads) 
* [Aria Mobile Companion App documentation](/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app)

## August Release - Project Aria Mobile App v125 is now available
8/22/2023

Dear Academic Partners,

Download the Aria Mobile App v125 to ensure you have all the latest features and capabilities.  Sign into the [Aria Web Portal](https://portal.projectaria.com) on your Android device to download v125.



### NEW & UPDATED FEATURES

* Ability to name VRS files via the Mobile Companion app
* The default recording profile (if set via Mobile or Desktop app) will now also be the default profile when initiating recordings via the Mobile app
* Added a feature that requires the app to be updated if the app build is flagged as severely buggy.

#### Ability to name VRS files

Historically, the VRS files were given random alphanumeric names. This made the recordings difficult to distinguish from one another in the Desktop app and after downloading them. With this new release, the name given to a recording when creating a custom recording defines the VRS file name. You’ll get a warning if there are two recordings with the same name on your Aria device.



To access this feature:

1. In the mobile app, go to Settings to check that you have v125
   1. Sign into [portal.projectaria.com](https://portal.projectaria.com/home) on your phone to get the latest recommended build
2. Go to device settings (select the gear icon next to your glasses) to check that you have 4963656.310.70 of the OS
   1. Aria glasses will automatically update if they’re connected to Wi-Fi and power
   2. Select **Check for Updates** in Device Settings to make sure you have the most recent version of the OS



How to name a recording:

Set the recording’s name when you create a custom recording, or edit the file name of any recording on your glasses. To edit the name or to give an existing recording a name:

1. Go to the recording tab
2. Select a recording
3. Select **Edit** on the top right corner

#### Default recording profile applied to new recordings

With this change, the default recording profile selected for the glasses also applies to each recording started from the app. Previously, the default recording profile only applied to recordings started by the capture button on the glasses.



Please double-check that the correct profile is selected before you start each recording, as the behavior has changed. Previously, the app kept its own last-used setting; with this change, the default will flip back to the default recording profile of the glasses on connection. This default recording profile can be updated [via Device Settings](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app#aria-device-settings) in the mobile app.

#### Disable severely buggy builds

This feature is a contingency plan, in case a severely broken app build is rolled out by mistake. In this situation, the app would show a full-screen dialog that requires it to be updated in order to proceed.

### BUG FIXES

Various bug fixes implemented to improve the overall usage of the App.



### PROJECT ARIA LATEST OS

The latest Project Aria OS build **4963656.310.70** was released on August 22, 2023.



### QUESTIONS, CONCERNS, FEEDBACK?

Contact Aria User Support by posting in [**Project Aria Academic Partner Announcements, Feedback & Support**](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/workplacegroup) or email [_AriaOps@meta.com_](mailto:AriaOps@meta.com).

7/11/23

Dear Academic Partners,

With this July release we’re pleased to announce a new documentation site on GitHub, Desktop Companion App v37, and Aria Mobile Companion App v120.

V37 of the Desktop Companion App updates the app to the new Project Aria branding, the ability to run the Desktop app from the command line and users will now be able to request Semi-Dense Point Cloud MPS.

[_Project Aria Tools_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/intro) is our new documentation site on GitHub. Information that used to be at [projectaria.com](http://projectaria.com/) is now in the [_Aria Research Kit section_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/about_ARK)of the site and no login is required to access the documentation.

Download the updated companion apps from the [_Aria Web Portal_](https://portal.projectaria.com/). If you sign in on your desktop computer, you’ll get the Desktop Companion app. If you sign in on your Android mobile device, you’ll download the Mobile Companion app.

### NEW AND UPDATED FEATURES

### Documentation now on GitHub

The documentation previously hosted at projectaria.com will now be hosted in Project Aria Tools.

Project Aria Tools is the new comprehensive website for all your documentation needs. It contains over 60 pages, covering technical specifications, data formats, data utilities you can use with your data, information and tooling for open data we’ve released and technical insights for deeper dives.

The [_Aria Research Kit_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/about_ARK) section contains information specific to Academic partners who have access to Aria glasses and MPS. We’ve added a few extra pages and updated the documentation for this release, updates include adding:

* [_Get the Right Size Glasses_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/frame_sizing) - sizing information if you’re ordering glasses (our small is surprisingly large!)

<br/>
<br/>

## Aria Mobile App v115 is now available
Dear Academic Partners,
The Aria Mobile App v115 for Android is now available for download from the [Aria Web Portal](https://portal.projectaria.com) (accessed via your Android internet browser).

### NEW & UPDATED FEATURES
* Sensor data quality signals
* In-Session personalized eye gaze calibration
* Differentiate paired glasses in the pairing screen
   * When you select **Add glasses**, the available Aria devices will be split into Paired Glasses and Other Glasses so that it’s easy to tell which glasses are already paired with the app.

#### Sensor Data Quality Signals
While making recordings, researchers will be able to see whether there are any sensor data quality issues (for example, due to thermal mitigation). To check for any issues, in the Mobile Companion app, view the "Sensor Status" section in the Recording Status Screen. Tap on the row to see full details. If you’ve initiated recording via the Capture button, access the Recording Status by selecting Recording in progress on the Mobile Companion app’s main dashboard.

#### In-Session Personalized Eye Gaze Calibration
Users will be able to record personalized eye gaze calibrations within an ongoing recording. The eye gaze calibration section of the sequence can be used to improve the eye gaze estimations in the rest of the recording. In the future, Machine Perception Services will be able to consume these recordings and output more accurate gaze information.

1. In the Mobile Companion app, create a new recording using a profile that includes ET and RGB cameras (such as Profile 15 or 25)
2. Once your recording has started, close the recording window
   * Select X on the top left of the screen
4. Go to Device Settings (select the gear next to your glasses)
5. Select Eye Tracking Calibration
6. Confirm that you’d like to run the during the current recording session
7. Follow the prompts to calibrate your glasses

#### Eye Gaze Calibration tips
##### Things to Avoid
❌ Do not wear a face covering during eye calibration.

❌ Choose an area with ample and even lighting; do not face a bright light, window or reflective surface.

❌ Do not set your phone screen brightness too high compared to your surroundings.

❌ Do not fully extend your arm(s) during eye calibration. Your elbows should be bent so that the phone is roughly 1 ft (30 cm) away from your face.

##### Helpful Tips
✅ The phone should be held straight in front of your face, so that you shouldn't look up or down to see the screen. Hold the phone plumb (90 degrees) vertically to the ground.

✅ The "Leveler" stage appears if the position of your phone isn't within specifications for the calibration process. Adjust the phone in front of you and its distance by bending your elbow until the smaller, black circle turns into a green disk with a check mark.

✅ Once the "Leveler" stage is successfully completed, do your best to keep your phone in exactly the same position throughout the full eye calibration process. If your phone is moved to a position no longer suited to calibrate your device, the app will return to the "Leveler" stage.

✅ The eye calibration stages 1 to 10 move your nose towards the direction indicated by the arrow. If you're only following the direction with your gaze without moving your head, the calibration stage will time out and fail. However, you make sure to keep your eyes fixed on the number within the dot the whole time.

### BUG FIXES
 Various bug fixes to improve the overall usage of the Companion App.
